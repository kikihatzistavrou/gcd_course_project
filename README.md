# Course Project for Coursera  Course : "Getting and Cleaning Data" 

This repository hosts the course project for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
of Johns Hopking University on Coursera.

It contains a script in R called run_analysis.R that does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

The dataset being used: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
