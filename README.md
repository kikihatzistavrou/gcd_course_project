# Course Project for Coursera  Course : "Getting and Cleaning Data" 

This repository hosts the course project for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
of Johns Hopking University on Coursera.

It contains a script in R called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

The dataset being used: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
